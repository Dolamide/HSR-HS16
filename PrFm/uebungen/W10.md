# Exercise: Types and Classes

## Exercise 1.
What are the types of the following values?

* `['a','b','c']` → `[Char]`
* `('a','b','c')` → `(Char, Char, Char)`
* `[(False,'O'),(True,'1')]` → `[(Bool, Int)]`
* `[(False,True),('0','1')]` →  ERROR!
* `([False,True],['0','1'])` → `([Bool], [Char])`
* `[tail, init, reverse]` → `[[a] -> [a]]`

## Exercise 2
Write down definitions that have the following types; it does not matter what the definitions actually do as long as they are type correct.

* `bools :: [Bool]` → `bools = [True, False]`
* `nums :: [[Int]]` → `nums = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 1], [12]]`
* `add :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int` → `add x y z = x+y+z`
* `copy :: a -> (a,a)` → `copy t = (t, t)`
* `apply :: (a -> b) -> a -> b` → `apply fn x = fn x`

## Exercise 3.
What are the types of the following functions?

* `second xs = head (tail xs)` → `second :: [t] -> t`
* `swap (x,y) = (y,x)` → `swap :: (x, y) -> (y, x)`
* `pair x y = (x,y)` → `pair :: x -> y -> (x, y)`
* `double x = x*2` → `double :: Num t => t -> t`
* `palindrome xs = reverse xs == xs` → `palindrome :: Eq a => [a] -> Bool`
* `twice f x = f (f x)` → `twice :: (t -> t) -> t -> t`

Hint: take care to include the necessary class constraints in the types if the
functions are defined using overloaded operator

## Exercise 4.
Check your answers to the preceding three questions using GHCi.

## Exercise 5.

Why is it not feasible in general for function types to be instances of the Eq class?

➪ There is no *normal form* which allows a comparison two functions since a particular porblem can be solved in very much different ways. Therefore, the comparison of two function types is not decidable.

When is it feasible?

➪ If the number of possible inputs is finite - then, it's possible to try them all and compare it.

Hint: two functions of the same type are equal if they always return equal results for equal arguments.

# Exercise: Defining Functions
## Exercise 1.

Using library functions, define a function `halve :: [a] -> ([a],[a])` that splits an even-lengthed list into two halves. For example:

```haskell
> halve [1,2,3,4,5,6]
([1,2,3],[4,5,6])
```

```haskell
halve :: [a] -> ([a],[a])
halve k = (take n k, drop n k)
            where n = length k `div` 2
```

## Exercise 2.
Define a function `third :: [a] -> a` that  returns  the  third  element  in  a list that contains at least this many elements using:

* `head` and `tail`

```haskell
third xs = head(tail(tail(xs)))
```

* list indexing `!!`

```haskell
third xs = xs !! 3
```

* pattern matching
```haskell
third (_ : (_ : (x : _))) = x
```

## Exercise 3.
Consider a function `safetail :: [a] -> [a]` that behaves in the same way as `tail` except that it maps the empty list to itself rather than producing an error. Using `tail` and the function `null :: [a] -> Bool` that decides if a list is empty or not, defined `safetail` using:

* a conditional expression

```haskell
safetail xs = if xs == [] then [] else tail xs
-- or
safetail xs = if null xs then [] else tail xs
```

* guarded equations

```haskell
safetail xs | null xs   = []
            | otherwise = tail xs
```

* pattern matching

```haskell
safetail [] = []
safetail xs = tail xs
-- or
safetail [] = []
safetail (_, xs) = xs
```

## Exercise 4.
In a similar way to `&&`, show how the disjunction operator `||` can be defined in four different ways using pattern matching.

```haskell
True || True = True
True || False = True
False || True = True
False || False = False
```

# Exercise 5.
Without using any other library functions or operators, show how the meaning  of  the  following  pattern  matching  definition  for  logical  conjunction `&&` can be formalised using conditional expressions:

```haskell
True && True = True
_    && _    = False
```

!!! todo

    Solve this

Hint: use two nested conditional expressions.

## Exercise 6.

Do the same for the following alternative definition, and note the difference in the number of conditional expressions that are required:

```haskell
True  && b = b
False && _ = False
```

!!! todo

    Solve this


## Exercise 7.
Show  how  the  meaning  of  the  following  curried  function  definition  can  be formalised in terms of lambda expressions:

```haskell
mult :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
mult x y z = x*y*z
mult = (\x -> \y -> \z -> x*y*z)

```

## Exercise 8.
The Luhn algorithm is used to check bank credit card numbers for simple
errors such as mistyping a digit, and proceeds as follows:

* consider each digit as a separate number
* moving left, double every other number from the second last
* subtract 9 from each number that is now greater than 9
* add all the resulting numbers together

if the total is divisible by 10, the card number is valid. Define a function `luhnDouble :: Int -> Int` that doubles a digit and subtracts 9 if the result is greater than 9.

For example:
```haskell
> luhnDouble 3
6
> luhnDouble 6
3
```


!!! todo

    Solve this

Using `luhnDouble` and the integer remainder function `mod`, define a function `luhn :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int -> Bool` that decides if a four-digit bank card number is valid.

For example:
```haskell
> luhn 1 7 8 4
True
> luhn 4 7 8 3
False
```


!!! todo

    Solve this


# Exercise: List Comprehensions

## Exercise 1.
Using a list comprehension, give an expression that calculates the sum $$1^2+2^2+ ... + 100^2$$
of the first one hundred integer squares.

```haskell
[x^2 | x <- [1..100]]
```

## Exercise 2.
Suppose that a coordinate grid of size `m x n` is given by the list of all pairs `(x, y)` of integers such that $$0 \le x \le m$$ and $$0 \le y \le n$$. Using a list comprehension,  define  a  function `grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int,Int)]` that returns a coordinate grid of a given size.

For example:

```haskell
> grid 1 2
[(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)]
```

```haskell
grid m n = [(x, y) | x<- [0..m], y<- [0..n]]
```

## Exercise 3.
Using a list comprehension and the function grid above, define a function `square :: Int -> [(Int,Int)]` that returns a coordinate square of size n, excluding the diagonal from `(0, 0)` to `(n, n)`.

For example:

```haskell
> square 2
[(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1)]
```

```haskell
-- without using grid
square n = [(x, y) | x<- [0..n], y<- [0..n], x /= y]
-- with grid
squre n = [(x, y) | (x, y) <- grid n n, x /= y]
```

## Exercise 4.

In a similar way to the function length, show how the library function `replicate :: Int -> a -> [a]` that produces a list of identical elements can be defined using a list comprehension. For example:

```haskell
> replicate 3 True
[True,True,True]
```

```haskell
replicate t v = [v | _<-[0..t]]
```

## Exercise 5.
A triple (x, y, z) of positive integers is Pythagorean if it satisfies the equation $$x^2 + y^2 = z^2$$. Using a list comprehension with three generators, define a function `pyths :: Int -> [(Int,Int,Int)]` that returns the list of all such triples whose components are at most a given limit. For example:

```haskell
> pyths 10
[(3,4,5),(4,3,5),(6,8,10),(8,6,10)]
```

```haskell
pyths n = [(x, y, z) | x<-[1..n], y<-[1..n], z<-[1..n], x^2+y^2 == z^2]
```

## Exercise 6.
A positive integer is perfect if it equals the sum of all of its factors, excluding the number itself. Using a list comprehension and the function factors, define a function `perfects :: Int -> [Int]` that returns the list of all perfect numbers up to a given limit. For example:

```haskell
> perfects 500
[6,28,496]
```

```haskell
factors n = [x | x<-[1..n-1], n `mod` x == 0]
perfects n = [x | x<-[1..n], sum (factors x) == x]
```

## Exercise 7.
Show how the list comprehension `[(x,y) | x <- [1,2], y <- [3,4]]` with two generators can be re-expressed using two comprehensions with single generators. Hint: nest one comprehension within the other and make use of the library function `concat :: [[a]] -> [a]`.

```haskell
concat [[(1, x) | x<-[3, 4]] , [(2, x) | x<-[3, 4]]]
```

## Exercise 8.
Redefine the function positions using the function find.

```haskell
find p xs = [x | x<-xs, p x]
```

## Exercise 9.
The scalar product of two lists of integers xs and ys of length n is given by the sum of the products of corresponding integers:

In a similar manner to chisqr, show how a list comprehension can be used to define a function `scalarproduct :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Int` that returns the scalar product of two lists. For example:

```haskell
> scalarproduct [1,2,3] [4,5,6]
32
```

```haskell
scalarproduct xs ys =  sum [x*ys !! i | (x, i) <- zip xs [0..]]
```

## Exercise 10.
Modify the Caesar cipher program to also handle upper-case letters.
