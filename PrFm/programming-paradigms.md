# Programming Paradigms

## Imperative

Imperative (befehlend) focuses on *how* it operates

Program = sequence of commands
computation = change of state

Common building blocks
* Assignment (x := x +1)
* Conditional execution (if...then...else)
* Repetition (while...do...)

Origin: "How computers work" (Neumann)

## Declarative

Group - contains *logical* and *functional* programming paradigms

Describes "what" should be done

How is left to the languate's implementation

Programs = Theories of a formal logic
Computation = Decductions

Examples: Spreadsheets, RegEx, SQL, XQuery, Haskell, Prolog..
